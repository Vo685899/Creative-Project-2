# Artist Statement 
My artistic practice explores the intersection of humor and artificial intelligence. For my creative project, I utilized AI to help image generation tools to create comedic visuals, leveraging the technology's unexpected interpretations and occasional misfires. I wanted to revisit the concept we covered in class about AI producing funny and humorous images and to expand on the challenges faced in doing so.

Humor, by its nature, thrives on surprise. Here, the "surprise" comes from the unpredictable nature of AI. I fed AI with prompts, nudging it towards a humorous scene. Asking AI to produce funny/humorous images was interesting because of the subjective nature of humor. As we discussed before, it can be difficult for AI to produce something “funny” when asked because in order for it to deliver an output it is missing a lot of information. Humor involves a lot of context, subjectivity, nuances in language, human emotion. All of these things are hard for a machine to take into consideration and produce something an individual like myself in particular would find funny. 

However, this creative process isn't without challenges. AI struggles with satire and subtle humor. Another challenge lies in the lack of human-like understanding of context. An image might be technically correct, but miss the comedic timing or cultural reference entirely. Also, there seemed to be a lot of commonalities in producing these images. As stated in my video, there was a lot of images produced with animals, political undertones, coloring commonalities. The AI used was also able to understand in me asking for so many images to suggest websites that contained “funny pictures”. 

These limitations become opportunities. The nonsensical can be surprisingly funny, and the unexpected turns can spark new comedic ideas. My role, then, becomes one of curating the AI's output, selecting the images that land the punchline and refining prompts based on the "machine's sense of humor." This allowed for me to choose the most humorous images to my liking that it produced. But also refine my prompt. 

Ultimately, my work aims to explore the potential of AI as a collaborator, not a replacement, in the artistic process. Its ability to generate unexpected imagery and embracing its limitations, I strive to create humor that is both thought-provoking and side-splitting. This creative project allowed me to explore the concept of producing humorous images deeper in using AI and understanding the challenges faced with it. 


# Work Summary
While AI excels at many tasks, cracking the code of humor remains tricky. AI struggles to grasp the cultural references and context that make things funny. For the creative project I wanted to dive deeper into this concept covered in class because I thought it was so intriguing about AI’s struggle in producing funny images. The process I used in utilizing AI to produce funny images was to ask Gemini was to do exactly that with some variation. Giving it prompts simply asking for funny images, humorous images and seeing what its interpretation of that was. I produced over 50 images and chose the best ones to show off in my video walkthrough. Some challenges were discovered as adding to the difficulty, humor is subjective, and translating wordplay or puns into visuals proves challenging for AI. I can see this being a great brainstorming tool, and if you were to narrow down the prompt it could generate something easier. However, I feel the future is bright. As AI gets better at understanding complex ideas and generating creative text formats, it might become a hilarious partner, learning from funny examples and generating images that tickle our collective funny bone.
